The objectives were to incoporate modules into the existing server and cli structure that I have. before there was one main module utilizing root go.mod file. Now there are two go.mod files one for the client and one for the server. The other objective I had was to allow the cli to get json file modify and send it to the server. Sawyer helped me out with this part where I helped him out with the modules. I'm having an issue with the way the flag is being called so i will modify that code once I fixed that code. I will spend sometime fleshing out the server side and than try to get testcases working using testify.

Update: fixed the json issues I believe and had added the outlines to start getting testcases to work I also further clean my code up
